### Summary:

Started career as graphic designer, have 7 year experience in conceptualising and managing digital 
marketing campaigns over social media and other mediums, specialised in rebranding projects.

When I heard about Adobe Sensei, which was based on artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
I realized how easy software tools can replace your boring everyday routine, and that the future of 
every profession can easily become programming. It was one of the most exciting discoveries, it 
made me throw everything and started over with a new career path. As every beginner, I started 
with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I almost have no working experience in this field, but I'm very fast learner and motivated. 
My daily routine includes reading technical documentations, doing quizzes, watching tutorials. 

I believe that my willingness to learn and ability to acquire new skills will help me become 
an experienced Frontend Developer.

### Code examples:

Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'. 
This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. 
If no element passes the test, return undefined.

      function findElement(arr, func) {
         let num = 0;
         for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
           num = arr[i];
           if (func(num)) {
             return num;
          }}
         return undefined;
     }
